	///
	/// The sink underneath holds exactly **one** waker. Epoxy's is a `wasm_streams`
	/// `IntoSink` whose `ready_fut`/`write_fut` are single `JsFuture`s, and polling a
	/// `JsFuture` replaces the waker it was last polled with. So a task that hands the
	/// lock back mid-operation can have its wakeup taken by whoever locks next, and is
	/// then unreachable: the sink no longer knows about it and it is in no queue. That
	/// showed up on the wire as a wisp stream sending CONNECT and never writing another
	/// byte while its siblings ran normally. Sitting in the waiter list means the next
	/// `unlock` brings it back whether or not its waker survived.
	///
	/// The lock is *not* simply held across `Pending` instead: nothing obliges a caller to
	/// re-poll the same method, and `futures-rustls` does exactly that — having written its
	/// `ClientHello` it abandons a pending `poll_flush` and reads instead. A held lock would
	/// never come back, deadlocking every other stream and the mux actor with it.
	///
	/// Releases the lock *without* waking the queue, unlike [`Self::unlock`]. We are only
	/// here because the sink itself is not ready, and everyone queued is waiting on that
	/// same sink, so waking them just has them find it not ready and wake us back — two
	/// writers on a stalled sink ping-pong forever and never make progress. Nobody is
	/// stranded by the silence: the sink is holding *our* waker right now (we polled it
	/// last), so we are the one it wakes when it opens, and the plain `unlock` that ends
	/// our operation is what drains the queue. If we are dropped before that, `Drop` ->
	/// `SinkState::remove` hands the wakeup on.
